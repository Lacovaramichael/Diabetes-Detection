# Project Goal
The purpose of this project was to create a mathematical model that would correctly diagnosis a patient as having diabetes or not, and to identify the biological factors that are most indicative of a positive diagnosis.

# Project Methods
This project utilized Python and the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle in order to build a machine learning model. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and a Naive Bayes Classifier were utilized, and the success of the project depended heavily on feature engineering and probability analysis.

# Project Results
The result of this project was an optimized Support Vector Machines model that achieved an 87% cross-validated prediction accuracy. The biological factors that were most indicative of a positive diagnosis were also found.
